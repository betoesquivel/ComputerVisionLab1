<H1>CE866 Laboratory: Assignment 1</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>You will recall the discussion in the lecture notes of <TT>cbir</TT>, a
program that performs content-based image retrieval.  You will also remember
that lectures discussed how vision algorithms are evaluated and compared.
This assignment brings these two topics together: you are required to write a
content-based image retrieval program of your own (<B>not</B> using exactly
the same algorithm as the program in the notes) and compare its performance
with that of <TT>cbir</TT>.  These two stages in the assignment are described
in more detail below.</P>

<H2>Content-based image retrieval</H2>

<P>The <TT>cbir</TT> program in the notes calculates the histogram of each
image (<EM>i.e.</EM>, there is one histogram, even if the image is a colour
one).  You are free to use any other viable algorithm that you can conceive
&mdash; the purpose of the assignment is not to out-perform <TT>cbir</TT>,
simply to have an alternative algorithm that you can compare with it.  If you
really cannot think of an algorithm to use, speak to a demonstrator who will
suggest one.</P>

<P>Having chosen an algorithm, you are required to write a program that
operates in the same way as <TT>cbir</TT>: your program must take a number of
image filenames on its command line, the first of which is the "probe image"
that you are trying to find in the other images supplied on the command line.
<STRONG>Your program should generate precisely one line of output</STRONG>,
the name of the image that best matches the probe image.  Your program must
explicitly ignore the case when the test image has the same name as the probe
image &mdash; if you seem to be getting perfect results, you have probably
forgotten to do this.  For inspiration, the <TT>cbir</TT> program discussed in
lectures is presented in the <A HREF="notes.pdf">lecture notes</A>.</P>

<P>You may implement your program in any of C, C++ or Python, and it
must use the OpenCV library.  You are free to use any OpenCV routines in your
program.</P>

<UL>

<LI><P>If you are using C or C++, you should supply a <TT>Makefile</TT> that
compiles your source code, generating an executable program called
<TT>mycbir</TT> &mdash; it must have that name to work with the test harness
discussed later in this assignment.</P></LI>

<LI><P>If you are using Python, your program must be called <TT>mycbir</TT>
(<EM>i.e.</EM>, with no <TT>.py</TT> extension).</P></LI> </UL>

<P>Your software must build and run under Linux on the machines in Computer
Lab&nbsp;1.</P>


<H2>Comparing and assessing algorithms</H2>

<P>The principles of evaluating a single algorithm and comparing the
performances of several algorithms is described in the lecture notes.  It is
not especially difficult to perform this kind of thing by hand &mdash; but it
is very tedious.  For this reason, evaluations are usually performed using
programs known as <EM>test harnesses</EM>.  For the second part of the
assignment, you will use a test harness and some image files to evaluate
<TT>mycbir</TT> and compare its performance with <TT>cbir</TT>.</P>

<P>The particular test harness you will use is <B>FACT</B> ("Framework for
Algorithm Comparison and Testing").  You need to <A
HREF="ce866-ass1.zip">download FACT and the relevant data files</A>.  FACT
separates the stages of executing a program on a series of tests and analyzing
the results.  This is because the execution stage is normally much slower than
the analysis one and, as we shall see, there are several analyses that one
might like to perform.  The execution stage produces a <EM>transcript</EM>
file, and all the analysis stages use transcript files as input.</P>

<P>The file <TT>ass1.fact</TT> contains the tests that are to be executed; it
is human-readable and you are welcome to look at it.  You should be able to
run the test on <TT>mycbir</TT> using the command

<PRE>
./fact execute ass1
</PRE>

The <TT>execute</TT> tells FACT to run the program on the test script
<TT>ass1.fact</TT> and output a transcript; you can use <TT>run</TT> rather
than <TT>execute</TT> if you prefer.  (Note that FACT uses the file
<TT>interface.py</TT> as an interface to the program being tested.)  When you
execute the above command, FACT will write output to your terminal window.
The first line contains some identification information, used for checking in
the analysis stages, followed by a single line per test.  These lines are
actually the transcript.</P>

<P>To create a transcript file, you simply use command-line
redirection to make these lines go to a file

<PRE>
./fact execute ass1 &gt; mycbir.res
</PRE>

and twiddle your thumbs while it runs.  Having generated the transcript, the
next stage is to analyze it, either in isolation or by comparing it with other
algorithms.</P>

<P>Analysing the transcript file is both quick and easy:

<PRE>
./fact analyse mycbir.res
</PRE>

Rather than <TT>analyse</TT>, you can write <TT>analyze</TT> or <TT>anal</TT>.
If the name of the file that you wish to analyse ends in <TT>.res</TT>, you
can omit it.  The results of the analysis are written to your terminal window;
you can use re-direction to save it in a file.  You will see that the output
contains two distinct tables, one summarising error rates <EM>etc.</EM> and
the other a confusion matrix, which shows how false positives occur.</P>

<P>FACT can generate HTML rather than plain text:

<PRE>
./fact --format=html --detail=2 -H -T analyse mycbir.res > mycbir.html
</PRE>

which you may find easier to read.

<P>Your next step is to compare the performance of your program,
<TT>mycbir</TT>, with the <TT>cbir</TT> program demonstrated in lectures.  The
transcript file from <TT>cbir</TT>, called <TT>cbir.res</TT>, is part of the
assignment distribution that you downloaded above, and you should have
generated <TT>mycbir.res</TT> above.  You perform the comparison using the
command

<PRE>
./fact compare mycbir.res cbir.res
</PRE>

Again, you can get more detail by appending <TT>--detail=2</TT> to the
command.</P>

<P>Having assessed the performance of <TT>mycbir</TT> in isolation and
compared it with that of <TT>cbir</TT>, you should insert the FACT outputs
into the comments at the top of your program <STRONG>and explain what they
mean</STRONG>.  This interpretation of the numerical results is an important
part of the assignment.</P>

<P>When you upload your submission, remember to upload the transcript file
from your algorithm too.</P>
